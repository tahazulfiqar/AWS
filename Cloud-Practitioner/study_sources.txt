I compiled my own notes when I was studying/practicing over the following FREE resources:

  1. FreeCodeCamp's Preparation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hLmDS179YE
  2. DigitalCloud CheatSheets: https://digitalcloud.training/certification-training/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner/
    
My notes are located here:

I STRONGLY recommend purchasing or finding practice tests and keep completing them until you're scoring 90% on each of them.
I used Neil Davis's Practice Tests and it provided extremely detailed explanations for the right and wrong answers.
